## How to Help?

Firstly, thanks for offering! It's really good to have helping hands :D

Anyways, helping is rather easy if you know your stuff! PM me the data on discord at "Nayuta Kani#0002" if you run into any issues! Here's what you have to do:
1) See how the folder structure is created, and name your file names appropriately.
2) Make a pull request!

## What data do you need?

Well, 2 things! Banner images, and skill record images!
